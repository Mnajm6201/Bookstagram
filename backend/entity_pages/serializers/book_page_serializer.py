  Name: BookPageSerializer.py
  Date: 03/22/2025
  Description: Django REST Framework serializer for the Book Page view. This serializer transforms a Book model instance into a JSON response suitable for a detailed book page. It includes custom representations for authors, primary edition, other editions, and genres using SerializerMethodFields.

  Input:
    - A Book model instance with related objects:
        • authors: Many-to-many relationship for author details.
        • editions: A queryset of edition objects (each with related edition images and publisher).
        • genres: A many-to-many relationship for genre details.
    
  Output:
    - A JSON object with the following fields:
        • id: Unique identifier of the book.
        • title: The book's title.
        • summary: A summary of the book.
        • average_rating: The book's average rating.
        • year_published: The publication year of the book.
        • original_language: The original language in which the book was written.
        • authors: A list of dictionaries with each author's id, name, and image.
        • primary_edition: A dictionary representing the primary edition of the book. The method prioritizes editions with a primary cover image, then any edition with a cover image, and finally falls back to the first edition if necessary.
        • other_editions: A list of dictionaries representing other editions (excluding the primary one) with limited details.
        • genres: A list of dictionaries, each containing the id and name of a genre.

  Notes:
    - The get_authors method extracts essential author information, including an image if available.
    - The get_primary_edition method optimizes the selection of a primary edition by checking for a primary cover image among related edition images. It falls back to other editions if necessary.
    - The get_other_editions method returns simplified data for all editions except the primary one.
    - The get_genres method formats genre information into a simple list of id/name pairs.
    - Prefetching and select_related are used in the methods to optimize database queries.
